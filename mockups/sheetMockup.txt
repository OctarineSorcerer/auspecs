---- how about a whole sheet mockup in this style?! ----
-- System stuff, if necessary. Makes it easier for everyone else and everything else
-- Let's say Pathfinder, for the sake of complexity and covering cases

-- Miscellaneous.  Don't need to give types? They'll all follow a format
-- either list all mods at the source, or all at the destination
-- Compiler should give warnings on repeat abbreviations
-- Does it need denoting if an empty group is an actual group? As opposed to an entry

-- Actually wasn't sure whether to do this incrementally (eg just BAB +1 here adding onto previous), or total. I'm almost thinking it should be incremental, as long as the display can bundle up additions from the same mods. (so for a given type of mod, you should be able to say if it stacks)
